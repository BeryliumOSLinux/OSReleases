# BerylliumOS: Reviving the Cub Linux Legacy

BerylliumOS is a free and open-source operating system built upon the foundations of the beloved Cub Linux project. It aims to breathe new life into the Cub Linux philosophy, offering a lightweight, user-friendly, and customizable desktop experience for modern users.

Inspired by the Past, Built for the Future:

BerylliumOS takes its design cues from the classic Cub Linux interface, offering a familiar and comfortable workspace for long-time Cub Linux users. However, it goes beyond simple nostalgia, incorporating modern features and functionalities to meet the demands of contemporary computing.

## Key Features:

*  Lightweight and Resource-Efficient: BerylliumOS prioritizes low resource consumption, making it ideal for older machines or systems with limited hardware capabilities.
    ChromeOS-like UI (2018): BerylliumOS embraces a user-friendly interface reminiscent of ChromeOS in its 2018 iteration, providing a clean and intuitive layout for both new and experienced users.
*    brosh - A Powerful Shell: BerylliumOS introduces brosh, a versatile command-line shell inspired by ChromeOS's crosh. brosh empowers users with extensive control over the system, catering to power users and those seeking a deeper level of interaction.
*   Customization Options: BerylliumOS allows users to personalize their experience through various themes and settings, ensuring a desktop environment tailored to individual preferences.
*    Open-Source Development: BerylliumOS embraces the power of open-source collaboration. Its codebase is freely available on GitHub, allowing the community to contribute, suggest improvements, and co-create the future of the project.

BerylliumOS is in active development, and the team welcomes contributions from the community. Join us on our journey to revitalize the Cub Linux legacy and create a vibrant new operating system for everyone!
